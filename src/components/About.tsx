              <p className="text-gray-600 mb-4">
                Computers have been a constant presence in my life for as long as I can remember. My fascination with technology deepened when I began exploring Linux environments over a year ago, learning to navigate the command line, manage packages, and troubleshoot system configurations. This hands-on experience opened my eyes to the deeper workings of operating systems and solidified my passion for understanding how technology works from the ground up.
              </p>
              <p className="text-gray-600">
                Currently, I'm pursuing a Computer Science degree through Western Governors University, which provides the academic foundation to complement my practical experience. The combination of self-directed learning and formal education has strengthened my understanding of both theoretical concepts and real-world applications. This innate curiosity for problem-solving is what draws me to IT support.
